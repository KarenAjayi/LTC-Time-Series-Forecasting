# Time Series Analysis for Litecoin Price Forecasting

## Executive Summary
This project investigates the dynamics of Litecoin (LTC) price movements over a five-year period (Dec 2018 – Dec 2023) using various time series forecasting models. The study aims to identify trends, seasonality, and stationarity issues while evaluating the performance of different forecasting methods. The project leverages statistical and machine learning models, including Naïve, Average Historical, Simple Average, Exponential Smoothing (Single, Holt’s Linear, Holt-Winters), ARIMA, and SARIMA models.

## Business Problem
The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, making accurate price forecasting crucial for traders and investors. Identifying patterns in time series data can provide actionable insights to enhance decision-making and risk management strategies. The key challenges in time series forecasting include seasonality, stationarity, missing values, and trend identification.

## Methodology
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding data distribution, trends, and stationarity tests.
- **Time Series Decomposition**: Identifying trend, seasonality, and residual components.
- **Forecasting Models Evaluated**:
  - **Naïve Method**: Uses previous data as a direct prediction.
  - **Average Historical & Simple Average Methods**: Compute mean-based forecasts.
  - **Exponential Smoothing (Single, Holt’s Linear, Holt-Winters)**: Smoothing techniques to model short- and long-term trends.
  - **ARIMA**: An autoregressive moving average model for non-seasonal data.
  - **SARIMA**: A seasonal variation of ARIMA for handling seasonality.

## Technologies & Tools Used
- **Python**: Main programming language for data analysis and modeling.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and statistical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization and trend analysis.
- **Statsmodels**: Used for implementing statistical forecasting models like ARIMA and SARIMA.
- **Scikit-learn**: Applied for accuracy metric calculations and preprocessing.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used for documentation, experimentation, and visualization.

## Key Findings
- **SARIMA outperformed ARIMA**, indicating that seasonality significantly impacts Litecoin prices.
- **Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters) was effective** in capturing short-term fluctuations.
- **Naïve and Historical Average methods underperformed**, providing lower accuracy compared to statistical models.
- **Stationarity tests** (Dickey-Fuller) revealed that differencing was required to stabilize the time series data.
- **Accuracy Metrics (RMSE, MAE, MAPE)** indicated that **SARIMA had the lowest error rate**, making it the best-performing model.

## Business Recommendations
- **Adopt SARIMA for Forecasting**: As the most accurate model, it should be integrated into trading algorithms for better decision-making.
- **Utilize Exponential Smoothing for Short-Term Trends**: This method provides reliable short-term forecasts, which can be useful for high-frequency trading.
- **Monitor Seasonal Patterns**: Litecoin prices exhibit seasonality, and investment strategies should be adjusted based on identified cyclical trends.
- **Enhance Data Collection & Processing**: Address missing values and improve data quality to boost forecasting accuracy.
- **Develop an Automated Trading Model**: Implement machine learning-based models incorporating real-time data for adaptive price prediction.

## Next Steps
- **Deploy the SARIMA model** in a real-world scenario to track performance against live data.
- **Improve Model Performance** by testing additional hybrid approaches, such as LSTM neural networks for deep learning-based forecasting.
- **Develop a Web-Based Dashboard** to visualize Litecoin price trends and provide real-time forecasting insights.
- **Expand the Study** to include other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum to validate model effectiveness across different assets.
